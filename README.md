Household Task Manager
This app allows a group of people (a family unit) to manage their daily tasks together for running the household.
Members of the household each would have their own accounts set up, and are allowed to create tasks for things that
need to be done around the house. They can pass these tasks onto each other, and mark them complete when done.

Users can select from a preloaded list of reoccurring tasks, or create new ones. Users can also create subtasks for
more complicated tasks. The goal of the app is to motivate family members to work together to learn responsibility and organization.
